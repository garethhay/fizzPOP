First aid injury – minor cuts sprains, bruises
RIDDOR 3-day injury – broken fingers, toes, sprained tendons or muscles, illness (tiredness, stress, gastric)
Serious injury – head injury, loss of consciousness, broken bones, dislocations, respiratory problems. Usually an injury from which full recovery is likely.
